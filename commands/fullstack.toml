# 💻 FULLSTACK DEVELOPER AGENT

Implementation task:

**Task:** {{args}}

## WHAT IS THIS?
Execute implementation phases with:
- File-level isolation
- Parallel safety (backend + frontend)
- QA integration

---

## WORKFLOW

### 1. Phase Analysis
```bash
# Check current plan
cat .gemini/active-plan

# Read phase file
cat plans/[date]-[topic]/phase-02-endpoints.md
```

### 2. Validate Ownership
Only work on files listed in phase spec!

### 3. Implement
Follow steps exactly as specified.

### 4. QA
```bash
npm run typecheck  # Must pass
npm test           # Must pass
```

### 5. Report
Create completion report.

## FILE OWNERSHIP RULES

### Phase File Format
```markdown
# Phase 02: API Endpoints

## File Ownership (Exclusive)
- src/api/users.ts
- src/schemas/*.ts
- tests/api/*.test.ts

## Shared (Read-Only)
- src/types/index.ts
- src/config/database.ts

## Dependencies
- Phase 01 must complete first

## Parallelization
- Can run with Phase 03 (Frontend)
```

### Critical Rules
| Rule | Action |
|------|--------|
| ✅ In ownership list | Edit freely |
| ⚠️ In shared list | Read only, never write |
| ❌ Not in any list | DO NOT TOUCH |
| 🛑 Conflict detected | STOP immediately |

---

## PARALLEL EXECUTION SAFETY

### Backend vs Frontend (No Overlap)
```
Phase 02 (Backend)        Phase 03 (Frontend)
├── src/api/              ├── src/components/
├── src/schemas/          ├── src/hooks/
├── src/services/         ├── src/pages/
└── tests/api/            └── tests/components/

No overlap → Safe for parallel execution
```

### Sequential vs Parallel
| Phase | Type | Rule |
|-------|------|------|
| 01, 04 | Sequential | Must run in order |
| 02, 03 | Parallel | Can run simultaneously |

---

## IMPLEMENTATION OUTPUT

### Report Format
```markdown
# Fullstack Dev Report: Phase 02

## Summary
- Files modified: 5
- Tests added: 3
- Time: 15 min

## Changes
| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| src/api/users.ts | Created |
| src/schemas/user.ts | Created |
| tests/api/users.test.ts | Created |

## QA Status
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors
- ✅ Tests: 12 passed

## Next Steps
- Phase 03 can now start (frontend)
- Phase 04 blocked until Phase 02 + 03 complete
```

---

## PRO TIPS

1. **Read active-plan first** - Check `.gemini/active-plan`
2. **Ownership strict** - If not in list, don't touch
3. **YAGNI** - Only implement what's in phase spec
4. **QA always** - typecheck + tests before reporting
5. **Report completion** - Unblock dependent phases

---

## COMMON PATTERNS

### Full-Stack Feature
```bash
# Phase 02: Backend API
/fullstack phase-02-api

# Phase 03: Frontend UI (parallel)
/fullstack phase-03-ui

# Phase 04: Integration (sequential)
/fullstack phase-04-integration
```

### Quick Implementation
```bash
# Without phase file
/fullstack implement user CRUD with React + API
```

---

## QA CHECKLIST

- [ ] TypeScript compiles
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] Only owned files modified
- [ ] Report created

> **Key Takeaway:** Execute phases with file isolation. Parallel backend/frontend = no conflicts.
