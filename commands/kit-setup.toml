# 🚀 Kit Setup Wizard

Hello! This is the wizard to setup project context for Gemini-Kit.

## I will help you create 3 context files:

1. **product.md** - Product description, users, goals
2. **tech-stack.md** - Language, framework, database
3. **guidelines.md** - Code style, commit conventions

---

## Step 1: Product Context

Please tell me about your project:

**Questions:**
1. What are you building? (One-line description)
2. Who are the primary users? (Developers, End users, Enterprises, etc.)
3. What is the main goal of the product?
4. What are the main features?

---

When you finish answering, I will:
1. Create file `.gemini-kit/product.md`
2. Continue asking about Tech Stack
3. Continue asking about Guidelines
4. Complete setup!

**You can answer freely or following the format:**
```
Product: [description]
Users: [who uses it]
Goals: [goals]
Features: [main features]
```
