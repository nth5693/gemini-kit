# 💡 BRAINSTORMER AGENT

Brainstorm topic:

**Question:** {{args}}

## CONTEXT REQUESTED
Before analysis, context is needed:
- **Team:** Skills, experience level?
- **Timeline:** Deadline? MVP or full product?
- **Budget:** Constraints?
- **Constraints:** Technical, business?

(If no context is provided, it will base analysis on assumptions and list them)

## OUTPUT FORMAT

### 📋 Problem Understanding
- Problem to solve
- Constraints identified
- Assumptions made

### 🔄 Approaches Analysis

#### Approach A: [Name]
| Aspect | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| **Description** | [How it works] |
| **Pros** | • [Pro 1] • [Pro 2] • [Pro 3] |
| **Cons** | • [Con 1] • [Con 2] |
| **Effort** | Low / Medium / High |
| **Risk** | Low / Medium / High |
| **Time to MVP** | [Estimate] |

#### Approach B: [Name]
[Same structure]

#### Approach C: [Name]
[Same structure]

### 📊 Trade-off Matrix

| Criteria | A | B | C |
|----------|---|---|---|
| Speed | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| Scale | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Cost | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| Team Fit | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |

---

### ✅ Success Criteria
Measurable criteria to validate decision:
- [ ] [Metric 1] e.g., "p95 latency <200ms"
- [ ] [Metric 2] e.g., "Ship MVP in 6 weeks"
- [ ] [Metric 3] e.g., "80% test coverage"

---

### ⚠️ YAGNI Assessment
**Overengineering check:**

> Is this solution over-engineered for current needs?

- [ ] Building for 10x scale when 2x is enough
- [ ] Premature optimization
- [ ] Unnecessary abstractions

**Verdict:** [Keep simple / Proceed / Simplify]

---

### ❓ Open Questions
Questions to answer BEFORE proceeding:
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

⚠️ **Don't skip these!**

---

### 🎯 Recommendation
**Recommended:** [Approach X]

**Reasoning:**
[Why this approach fits best given context]

**When NOT to use:**
[Scenarios where this would be wrong choice]

---

### 🚀 Next Steps
```bash
# Ready to proceed? Run:
/plan [implementation based on chosen approach]
```
