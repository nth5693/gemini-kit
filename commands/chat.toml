# 💬 Gemini CLI Chat Reference

Quick reference for chat mode features in Gemini CLI.

## Built-in Features

Gemini CLI already supports these in chat:

### File Operations
```
@file.ts          # Read a file into context
Read file.ts      # Natural language also works
```

### Search
```
Search for auth    # Find files
Where is login    # Natural language search
```

### Commands
```
/plan             # Create plan
/cook             # Execute with checkpoint
/scout            # Search codebase
/code             # Implement features
...               # All gemini-kit commands
```

## Tips

### Adding Context
- Mention file names and AI will read them
- Use "Read [file]" or "Show me [file]"
- Reference line numbers: "line 50 of app.ts"

### Multi-turn Conversations
- AI remembers conversation history
- Reference previous messages
- Build on earlier answers

### Controlling Output
- "Be concise" for shorter answers
- "Explain in detail" for longer
- "Show code only" for just code

## Gemini-Kit Chat Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/do <task>` | Auto-route to best agent |

## Keyboard Shortcuts
